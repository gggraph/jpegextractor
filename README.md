## JPEG Extractor

Command-line software that can **extract .jpeg from a corrupted FAT32 device**. 

There is probably existing software that can do this, but most are not free.

The software was written for a special case. A SD card had its file allocation table erased during a bad copy operation: files were lost and card was unreadable.
A luck that the device was used by a camera which written files data in an incremental manner.
